                        a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                        adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older

                        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                        assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                        whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
